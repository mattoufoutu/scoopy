# Scoopy
--------

**/!\\ Warning: this library is still in development and is therefore it is not usable yet /!\\**

## 1. About it:

Scoopy is a python library meant to interact with [Scoop.it](http://scoop.it) API in
an easy and pythonic way.

## 2. Installing it:

### a) Dependencies:

* python-oauth2

### b) Setup:

#### From GitHub:

    git clone git://github.com/mattoufoutu/scoopy.git
    cd scoopy
    python setup.py install

#### From PyPI:

TODO

## 3. Compatibility:

Scoopy is tested with many Python versions and works with the following versions:

* 2.4
* 2.5
* 2.6
* 2.7

### Why is there no Py3k support?

Well, I would like to, but unfortunately, python-oauth2 (on which scoopy depends)
isn't compatible with Py3k.

## 4. Documentation:

The complete documentation and API reference is available [here](http://scoopy.rtfd.org).

A [manpage](http://media.readthedocs.org/man/scoopy/latest/scoopy.1) and an [epub](http://media.readthedocs.org/epub/scoopy/latest/scoopy.epub) version of the documentation is also available.
